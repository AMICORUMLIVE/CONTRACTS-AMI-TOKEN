<b>Description of the Project - WE ARE AMICORUM – AMICORUM.LIVE</b>

AMICORUM (Latin word close to the meaning of Gathering of Friends) is an innovative platform that will decentralize the ticket re-sale industry using blockchain and secure identity platform.  The platform will be secure, transparent and free of any transaction/processing fees for buying and selling of only authenticated tickets in the secondary re-sale market.  
Sellers will be able to list their tickets in fiat (using a market-feed oracle, the platform will calculate AMI prices at the time of purchase) that will be authenticated with smart contract and Buyer’s will be able to buy tickets with the AMI token (the new cryptocurrency based on Ethereum blockchain) at 0 transaction fee and 0 processing fees.

Rewards will also be offered to users for transacting on the platform.

AMICORUM.LIVE will be a secure, transparent and “0” transaction/processing fee based blockchain ecosystem for the ticket re-sale industry, eliminating transaction costs, fraud and empowering ticket buyers.

During the process, the seller will list their ticket.  Ticket prices will be denominated in fiat currency and using a market-feed oracle, the platform will calculate AMI prices at the time of purchase.

# AMI TOKEN

AMICORUM.LIVE platform will be powered by AMI Tokens.  The ERC20 compatible token will be the only Utility tokens that will be used on the platform for sale and purchase of tickets in the secondary re-sale market. The tokenization model focuses on real time conversion of ticket price into AMI Tokens (value from exchange) and usage by both buyers and sellers.

The AMI token will be listed on exchanges (to be announced) and will be transferrable to other cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies.

The AMI TOKEN will be the only means of payment on the AMICORUM.LIVE platform
